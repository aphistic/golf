Golf is an MIT-licensed Go client library for servers supporting the Graylog
Extended Log Format (GELF, https://www.graylog.org/resources/gelf-2/).

At this point the library doesn't have a lot (any?) of tests written but I hope
to start writing them sooner than later.  If you run into any issues with the
library or have any feature requests, please create issues for them!

As this library is very new, the API could still change.  I don't expect it to change much because I'm pretty happy with how it is now but if anyone has suggestions easier ways to use the library via API changes I would be open to it.
